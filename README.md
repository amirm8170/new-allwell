[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Installation

## Explain application for backend:

this is simple application with mongoDB for store user's data and JWT to secure, secure route and nodemailer to send mail to user to change the password. also there is bcrypt to encrypt password before save in db.
define routes:
1- POST /signup: it takes an email and password and it used DTO to best practice and if any time we need update, we can update just dto file and also export this file is so easier than create new object with the same elements every time. after takes them from body so it can store it in mongoDB.

2- GET /login: it takes email and password and check if email and password are are valid in db so it let the user to login.

3- POST /email-change-password: if user want to change his password, so he should send his email in body and if email is valid then nodemailer send new mail as html type with button to redirect to change password page.

4- PUT /change-password/:id: user should send password and confirm password in body and they were the same, and the id that he send to api with params was correct so the password going to change and it returns user with new password as response, and as you see password, will hash again with bcrypt and then store in db.

5- GET /auth/:id: client should send id in params and if id is valid in type and also valid in db, so it returns id as response.this route is for check this user's id is valid or no. it used when user confirmed his email, backdoor of that button in email has this api and check user id before redirect to change password route.

6- GET /auth: this route protected with jwt. and can check headers of request and if Bearer token was valid so it can let user to go ahead.

and the Templates folder is for ejs file that prepared for send in mail.
